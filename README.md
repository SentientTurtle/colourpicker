# Colour picker

A simple plain-JS colour picker

This was made as a visual aid to understand colour luminance in the context of the standard HSV colour picker.

Whilst this tool should not be used for any design or colour work, [an online demo is available here.](https://sentientturtle.github.io/colourpicker/picker.html)
